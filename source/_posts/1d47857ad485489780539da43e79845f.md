## Why You Need a Password Manager

A password manager helps you securely store and manage strong, unique passwords for all your online accounts. Instead of remembering dozens of complex passwords, you only need to remember one strong **master password**. This greatly reduces the risk of password reuse, weak passwords, and phishing attacks.

## Recommended Password Manager: **Bitwarden.eu**

I recommend **Bitwarden** because it is **open-source, secure, and easy to use**. The European instance, **Bitwarden.eu**, is hosted in the EU, follows strong data protection regulations, and is less likely to be seized by an insane government.

### Key Benefits of Bitwarden:

- **Stores and autofills passwords securely**
- **Works across all devices** (Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, browser extensions)
- **Supports Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for added security, which we'll talk about later
- **Encrypted with zero-knowledge architecture**, meaning not even Bitwarden staff  can access your vault - only you
- **Free to use with optional premium features**

## Step 1: Sign up for Bitwarden

Go to <https://vault.bitwarden.eu/#/signup> and follow the process. Make sure that **bitwarden.eu** is selected in the drop down

## Step 2: Create a Strong Master Password

Your master password protects all your saved credentials, so it must be **strong and unique**. Follow these guidelines:
âœ… Use at least **14-20 characters**. (My passphrase is 75 characters long)
âœ… Include a mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
âœ… Avoid common words, names, or dates. Avoid information that is personal to you that can be discovered through Facebook or other public information
âœ… Use a passphrase (e.g., **"Dragon!Tree$Lemon99"**, or **"Sometimes late at night, 1 lie awake and watch 4 dreaming!"**)
âœ… **Four or more random words** put together that you can memorise with an image is surprisingly secure. [This website](https://www.correcthorsebatterystaple.net/index.html) helps you generate them.
âœ… **Do not reuse** a password from any other account or any password you have ever previously used.

ðŸ”¹ **Tip:** Use [Bitwardenâ€™s password strength tester](https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/) to check your master password.

## Step 3: Install Bitwarden on Your Devices

### **Windows & Mac**

1. Go to **<https://bitwarden.com/download>**.
2. Download and install the **desktop app** for your operating system.
3. Open Bitwarden and **log in** with your new master password.

### **iPhone & Android**

1. Open the **App Store (iPhone) or Google Play Store (Android)**. (or use the links at [bitwarden.com/download](https://bitwarden.com/download))
2. Search for **Bitwarden Password Manager**.
3. Install the app and **sign in**.
4. Enable **autofill** so Bitwarden can suggest and fill in passwords for apps and websites.
   - **iPhone:** Settings â†’ Passwords â†’ AutoFill Passwords â†’ Enable Bitwarden.
   - **Android:** Settings â†’ Passwords & security â†’ Auto-fill service â†’ Select Bitwarden.

### **Browser Extension (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)**

1. Visit **<https://bitwarden.eu/download>**.
2. Select your browser and install the **Bitwarden extension**.
3. Log in and pin the extension for quick access.

## Step 4: Save Your First Passwords

Start by adding **important accounts** (email, banking, social media) to Bitwarden. Use the Bitwarden password generator to create **strong, unique passwords** for each one. Change the passwords, don't just add the current password.
Because you don't have to remember them, you can make these as strong as the site will support.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a secure password manager, tomorrowâ€™s task will be to **enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** to add an extra layer of security to your most critical accounts.

âœ… **Action for Today:** Install Bitwarden on all your devices and secure your first few accounts!
