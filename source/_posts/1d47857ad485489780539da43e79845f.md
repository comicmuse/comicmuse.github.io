## Why You Need a Password Manager

A password manager helps you securely store and manage strong, unique passwords for all your online accounts. Instead of remembering dozens of complex passwords, you only need to remember one strong **master password**. This greatly reduces the risk of password reuse, weak passwords, and phishing attacks.

## Recommended Password Manager: **Bitwarden.eu**

We recommend **Bitwarden** because it is **open-source, secure, and easy to use**. The European instance, **Bitwarden.eu**, is hosted in the EU and follows strong data protection regulations.

### Key Benefits of Bitwarden:

- **Stores and autofills passwords securely**
- **Works across all devices** (Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, browser extensions)
- **Supports Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for added security
- **Encrypted with zero-knowledge architecture**, meaning only you can access your vault
- **Free to use with optional premium features**

## Step 1: Create a Strong Master Password

Your master password protects all your saved credentials, so it must be **strong and unique**. Follow these guidelines:
âœ… Use at least **14-20 characters**
âœ… Include a mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
âœ… Avoid common words, names, or dates
âœ… Use a passphrase (e.g., **"Dragon!Tree$Lemon99"**)
âœ… **Do not reuse** a password from another account

ðŸ”¹ **Tip:** Use [Bitwardenâ€™s password strength tester](https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/) to check your master password.

## Step 2: Install Bitwarden on Your Devices

### **Windows & Mac**

1. Go to **<https://bitwarden.eu/download>**.
2. Download and install the **desktop app** for your operating system.
3. Open Bitwarden, **create an account**, and **log in** with your new master password.

### **iPhone & Android**

1. Open the **App Store (iPhone) or Google Play Store (Android)**.
2. Search for **Bitwarden Password Manager**.
3. Install the app and **sign in**.
4. Enable **autofill** so Bitwarden can suggest and fill in passwords for apps and websites.
   - **iPhone:** Settings â†’ Passwords â†’ AutoFill Passwords â†’ Enable Bitwarden.
   - **Android:** Settings â†’ Passwords & security â†’ Auto-fill service â†’ Select Bitwarden.

2. Select your browser and install the **Bitwarden extension**.
3. Log in and pin the extension for quick access.

## Step 3: Save Your First Passwords
