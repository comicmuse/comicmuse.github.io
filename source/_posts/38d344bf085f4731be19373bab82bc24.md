## Why Account Recovery Matters

Even with strong passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), you may lose access to an account due to:

- **Forgetting your password** (especially for rarely used accounts).
- **Losing your 2FA device** (phone theft, reset, or upgrade).
- **A hacked or compromised email account**.

Today, we’ll ensure your **recovery options are secure** so you can regain access if needed.

## Step 1: Check Your Recovery Email

Most accounts let you reset your password via email. Your recovery email should be:
✅ **A secure, active email account** (preferably your primary one).
✅ **Protected with a strong password and 2FA** (see **Day 5** if using Gmail).
✅ **Not an old work or university email** (you could lose access if you change jobs or graduate).

If you don't have a second email address, consider using your spouse or partner's email for recovery. This will allow them to unlock your account if you get locked out.

### How to Check and Update Recovery Emails:

1. Log into your **email provider**.
2. Check and update the **recovery email** in your settings.
3. If you use multiple email accounts, consider consolidating recovery emails to a **single secure address**.

## Step 2: Secure Your Phone Number (if used for Recovery)

Some services allow password recovery via text message, but **phone-based recovery is risky** due to SIM-swapping attacks.

🔹 **If you must use phone-based recovery:**

- Ensure your phone number is **up-to-date**.
- Set up a **PIN** with your mobile carrier to prevent unauthorized SIM swaps.

## Step 3: Store 2FA Recovery Codes Securely

Many accounts provide **backup codes** when you enable 2FA. These are crucial if you lose your device.

🔹 **Where to Store Recovery Codes:**
✅ **Bitwarden** (store them securely as notes or in the login entry).
✅ **A secure, offline backup** (printed and kept in a safe place).
❌ **Avoid storing them in your email or cloud storage**
❌ **Avoid storing them unencrypted** as text files on your computer or in OneNote for example.

### How to Find or Generate New 2FA Backup Codes:

1. Log into an account where you’ve enabled 2FA.
2. Go to **Security Settings → Two-Factor Authentication**.
3. Look for **“Backup Codes”** or **“Recovery Codes”**.
4. Save them securely in Bitwarden or another safe location.

You may need to disable and re-enable 2 Factor Authentication in order to get a new set of Recovery codes.

## Step 4: Review Your Account Recovery Questions

If a site uses security questions, ensure they are:
✅ **Not easy to guess** (e.g., avoid real answers like “mother’s maiden name” that can be found online).
✅ **Stored in Bitwarden** as part of the login entry.
✅ **Fake but memorable** (e.g., for “What was your first car?” you could enter **“BlueDragon1986”** instead of a real car name).

Essentially, use them as additional passwords.
