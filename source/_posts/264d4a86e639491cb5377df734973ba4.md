*Note for anyone who finds this: This is written for my family. The advice is pretty general and usable by everyone, but I will be opinionated and I'm not trying to cover all tools and use-cases*

Over the next 30 days, I'm going to give you some ways to improve your online security. I'll try and make it one action a day, and broadly try to keep it to things you can do in a half hour.

The threat model I'm using is:

- Opportunistic threat actors attempting to steal data, bank cards, identity theft and similar kinds of fraud
- Leaking private data across the web when you are using your phones and computers

I'm not going to aim to address determined attackers who are targetting you individually.

Let's get started:

- [Day 1: Use a Password Manager](/p/1d47857ad485489780539da43e79845f)

- [Day 2: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](/p/d5ab1159bc6743b39bf7fafb4e9e4ab8)

- [Day 3: Check for Leaked Passwords](/p/c906788cd7674cb98be27c4bff29e3b6)

- [Day 4: Simplify and Plan Ahead](/p/f43f6fb8454e43598e3c3be04a004f06)

- [Day 5: Secure Your Email Accounts](/p/f19d1d6e6f594a2cbdcaa55f4dba0c00)

- [Day 6: Remove Old and Unused Accounts](/p/9a5b7d37a90f4668b74340be9ea08951)

- [Day 7: Review Account Recovery Methods](/p/38d344bf085f4731be19373bab82bc24)
