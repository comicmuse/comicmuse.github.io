## Why Checking for Leaked Passwords is Important

When a company is hacked, its stored usernames and passwords can be leaked online. Hackers use these leaked credentials to try logging into other accountsâ€”a tactic known as **credential stuffing**.

By checking whether your passwords have been exposed in a data breach, you can **change them before hackers exploit them**.

## Step 1: Use Bitwardenâ€™s Data Breach Report

Bitwarden provides a **Data Breach Report** feature that checks if your email addresses have been involved in known breaches.

### How to Check for Leaked Passwords in Bitwarden:

1. **Open Bitwarden** (the website), login and go to **Reports â†’ Data Breach**.
2. Enter your **email addresses**.
3. Bitwarden will list any breaches associated with your email.
4. For each compromised account, **change the password immediately** (see Step 3).

ðŸ”¹ **Tip:** If you find breached accounts you no longer use, consider **deleting them** instead of securing them.

## Step 2: Use Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)

[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a widely-trusted tool for checking whether your email or password has appeared in a data breach.

### How to Check for Breaches:

1. Visit **<https://haveibeenpwned.com/>**.
2. Enter your **email address** and check for breaches. (Don't worry - this is safe)
3. If your email is found in breaches, change the passwords for affected accounts **and any other accounts that use the same password**

## Step 3: Change Compromised Passwords

For any account with a leaked password:

1. **Log into the affected account**.
2. **Change the password** to a new, strong, unique password (use Bitwardenâ€™s password generator).
3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** if possible.
4. **Update your saved login in Bitwarden**.

You should also consider other accounts that use the same email and password combination. Concentrate on the most important accounts first.

## Next Steps

Tomorrowâ€™s task will focus on **simplifying your browser setup**, and will be a lighter day.

âœ… **Action for Today:** Run a breach check on your main email addresses and update any compromised passwords!
