## Why Removing Old Accounts Matters

Over time, we create accounts for various services—some we forget about entirely. Every unused account is a potential **security risk**, especially if:

- The company suffers a **data breach**.
- You **reused a password** that may have leaked.
- The account contains **personal information** that could be exploited.

Reducing the number of online accounts **limits your exposure to future breaches** and makes managing your digital life easier.

## Step 1: Find Your Old Accounts

To identify old accounts:

1. **Search Your Email** – Look for old account sign-up confirmations (search for “Welcome to” or “Your account”).
2. **Use Have I Been Pwned** – Check if your email appears in breached databases, which may remind you of old accounts.
3. **Try Signing In** – If you suspect an account exists, attempt a login or password reset.
4. **Use Bitwarden** – this isn't so useful now, since we're just getting started with it, but this should become a regular habit, so doing this once a year will be good.

## Step 2: Delete Unused Accounts

For each unused account:

1. **Log in** and go to the settings or account section.
2. Look for **“Delete Account”**, **“Close Account”**, or similar options.
3. If you can't find a deletion option, search online for "how to delete \[service] account".
4. If account deletion is unavailable, remove personal data, change to a **random password** (stored in Bitwarden), and remove recovery options.

🔹 **Tip:** Some sites require contacting support to request account deletion.

## Step 3: Unsubscribe from Unwanted Services

While reviewing old accounts, take a moment to **unsubscribe from unnecessary email lists**. This reduces spam and improves online hygiene.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow, we’ll focus on **reviewing and securing your account recovery methods**, ensuring you can regain access if something goes wrong.

✅ **Action for Today:**

- Identify and delete old accounts.
- Unsubscribe from unwanted services.
- Secure any remaining accounts with strong passwords and 2FA.
