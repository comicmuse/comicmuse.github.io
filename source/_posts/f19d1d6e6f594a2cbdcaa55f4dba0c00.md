## Why Email Security is Critical

Your email account is the **gateway to your digital life**‚Äîit‚Äôs used to reset passwords for other accounts, receive sensitive information, and verify identities. A compromised email account puts **all your other accounts at risk**.

Since I think you all use **Gmail**, I'll focus on **securing your Google Account** but also includes general advice applicable to other email providers.

## Step 1: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Your Email

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) prevents hackers from accessing your email even if they steal your password. If you didn't do this yesterday, let's do it today.

### How to Enable 2FA on Gmail (Google Account)

1. **Go to** [Google‚Äôs Security Page](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Under **"Signing in to Google"**, click **"2-Step Verification"**.
3. Click **"Get Started"** and sign in if prompted.
4. **Choose an authentication method**:
   - **Authenticator App (Recommended)** ‚Äì Use Bitwarden
   - **SMS (Not Recommended, but better than nothing)**.
5. Follow the instructions to complete setup and test your 2FA method. Don't forget you can use the camera icon in the bitwarden edit page to capture the QR code.

## Step 2: Check for Unauthorized Access

Hackers may already have access to your email without you realizing it. Google provides tools to check this:

1. Go to **[Google's Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)**.
2. Look under **"Your devices"** for unfamiliar logins.
3. Under **"Recent security events"**, check for unrecognized activity.
4. If anything looks suspicious, **sign out of all devices** and change your password immediately.

## Step 3: Use a Strong, Unique Password

Your email password should be **long, unique, and stored in Bitwarden**.

üîπ **How to change your Gmail password:**

1. Visit **[Google Account Password Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)**.
2. Click **"Password"** and sign in.
3. Generate a new **random, long password** (at least 16+ characters) using Bitwarden.
4. Update the password in Bitwarden and save it.

## Step 4: Check Email Forwarding and Recovery Options

Attackers often set up **email forwarding rules** or change recovery settings to maintain access.

üîπ **Check for unauthorized email forwarding in Gmail:**

1. Open **Gmail** and go to **Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí See all settings**.
2. Click on **"Forwarding and POP/IMAP"**.
3. Ensure no unknown email addresses are set to receive forwarded emails.

üîπ **Check recovery options:**

1. Go to **[Google Recovery Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)**.
2. Ensure only **your phone number and a trusted recovery email** are listed.

## Step 5: Be Wary of Phishing Emails

Hackers use phishing emails to trick you into revealing passwords or clicking malicious links.

**Common phishing red flags:**
‚úÖ Urgent requests like "Your account will be closed!"
‚úÖ Emails asking you to **confirm login details**.
‚úÖ Fake links (hover over links before clicking to see where they are going, but even still be careful)
‚úÖ Unexpected attachments‚Äînever open them unless you are 100% sure they are safe.

üîπ **If in doubt, go directly to a website by typing in the address instead of clicking a link.**

## Next Steps

Tomorrow will be a lighter day. We'll look at some **browser settings** to make bitwarden work better.

‚úÖ **Action for Today:**

- Enable **2FA** on your Gmail account.
- Check for unauthorized logins and forwarding rules.
- Change to a strong, unique password.
- Review your recovery options.
