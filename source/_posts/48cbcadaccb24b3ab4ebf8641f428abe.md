## Why Mobile Security Matters

Your smartphone and tablet contain a **huge amount of personal information**—emails, banking apps, passwords, and more. If compromised, an attacker could access your accounts, steal personal data, or install spyware. Over the next few days, we’ll ensure your mobile devices are secure.

## Enable Strong Device Security

### **Use a Strong Lock Screen**

1. **Set a PIN (6+ digits) or password** instead of a pattern or short PIN.
2. **Use biometric authentication (fingerprint or Face ID)** for convenience and security. However, be aware that these are intrinsically less secre than a 6-digit pin. Consider your threat model.
3. **Disable Smart Lock features that keep the phone unlocked** in certain locations (e.g., "Trusted Places").

✅ **Action for Today:**

- **Enable a strong PIN/password and/or biometrics.**
