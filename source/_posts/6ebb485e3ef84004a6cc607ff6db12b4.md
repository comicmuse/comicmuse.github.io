## Why Securing Your Wi-Fi Matters

Your home Wi-Fi is the gateway to all your online activity. If someone gains access, they can:

- **Intercept your internet traffic** (risking sensitive data exposure).
- **Use your connection for illegal activity**.
- **Attack your devices** (especially smart home gadgets with weak security).

Today, weâ€™ll **lock down your Wi-Fi** to prevent unauthorized access and improve security.

## Step 1: Change Your Routerâ€™s Default Admin Password

Routers come with a default username and password (e.g., `admin/admin`), which hackers can easily find online. If your router came from your Internet provider, it's more likely to have a better password, but let's check.

ðŸ”¹ **To change your routerâ€™s admin password:**

1. Connect to your Wi-Fi and open a web browser.
2. Type your routerâ€™s IP address (usually `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`). It should be on a label on the router.
3. Log in using your routerâ€™s default credentials (often printed on the router itself).
4. Go to **Admin Settings** or **Security Settings**.
5. Change the password to a **strong, unique password** (store it in Bitwarden).

## Step 2: Use a Strong Wi-Fi Password & WPA3 or WPA2 Security

Your Wi-Fi password should ideally be **long, random, and stored in Bitwarden**. Avoid using family names, birthdays, or common words.
*It is probably easiest to do this when you're changing WiFi routers, as you will need to update all the devices that connect to it. If you don't intend to change WiFi for a while, you can consider updating the password, but you'll have to co-ordinate with everyone in the house.*

ðŸ”¹ **To update your Wi-Fi security settings:**

1. Log into your router (as in Step 1).
2. Navigate to **Wi-Fi Settings** or **Wireless Security**.
3. Set **Encryption Type** to **WPA3** (if available) or **WPA2** (avoid WEP, which is outdated and insecure).
4. Update your Wi-Fi password to a strong one and save it in Bitwarden.

## Step 3: Disable WPS & Remote Management

ðŸ”¹ **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)** makes connecting devices easier but is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
ðŸ”¹ **Remote Management** allows logging into your router from outside your home, which is risky.

To disable these:

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** in your router.
2. **Disable WPS**.
3. **Disable Remote Management** (often found under Remote Administration or WAN settings).

## Step 4: Separate Guest and Smart Home Devices

If your router supports **Guest Wi-Fi**, set it up for visitors and smart home devices to isolate them from your main network.

ðŸ”¹ **To enable a Guest Network:**

1. Go to **Wi-Fi Settings**.
2. Enable **Guest Network**.
3. Set a **separate strong password** (store in Bitwarden).

## Step 6: Consider Upgrading an Older Router

If your router is more than **5 years old**, it may lack security updates. Consider a newer router with **WPA3 support and automatic updates**.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow, weâ€™ll focus on **securing your mobile devices**, ensuring your phones and tablets stay protected.

âœ… **Action for Today:**

- Change your routerâ€™s admin password.
- Ensure **WPA3 or WPA2 encryption** is enabled.
- Disable **WPS and Remote Management**.
- Set up a **Guest Network** if possible.
- Check for **firmware updates**.
